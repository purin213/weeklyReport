# 2023/11/20 - 2023/11/26

## overall objective
get a jobs as a backend engineer in Auckalnd, NZ

## what I want to do
- Finish FoodServiceSimulator(https://github.com/purin213/FoodServiceSimulation)
- Know more nginx

## what was done
- Finished FoodServiceSimulater for now. (some output aren't of intended but will get back it after I'm much more confortable with PHP)
- nginx research is coming nicely but would like to know more

## this week I learned
- php routing settings (namespace, use, autoloads) are convinient yet confusing for begginers
- hacklang and HHVM seems interesting
- new vim commands like (q, @)
- learned the DVP keyboard layout and I think I can type much more with less fatigue

### looking back
- Lots of thinking and researching/prototyping was done and would have liked to do much more coding. Will try to improve in the coming week.
