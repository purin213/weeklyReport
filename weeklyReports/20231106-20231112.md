## overall objective
get a jobs as a backend engineer in Auckalnd, NZ

## what I want to do
- Finist static web server
- Make more time to study
## what was done
- Web server is done! Online at (deepsea.oaga.pro)
- Learned how to migrate neovim config through github dotfiles into my ubuntu vm
### looking back
- Making time during the morning worked better for studying for me.
- Nginx routing and the whole way it works is still a blur for me, so some further deep dive could do me good.
